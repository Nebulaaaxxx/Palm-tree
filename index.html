      <h2>üåø Welcome to Our Palm Garden</h2>
      <p>At HIM, our garden is more than just a green space ‚Äî it‚Äôs a living classroom, a symbol of innovation, and a celebration of the world‚Äôs natural diversity. One of the most striking features of our landscape is the Chinese Windmill Palm (Trachycarpus fortunei), a resilient and elegant species that adds a sense of calm and exotic beauty to our campus. But beyond its aesthetic appeal, this palm represents something deeper: the blending of cultures, climates, and sustainable values.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>üåç Globalization Isn‚Äôt Just for People</h2>
      <p>We often think of globalization as something that applies to technology, trade, or culture ‚Äî but plants are part of this story too. The Chinese Windmill Palm is not native to Switzerland, yet it has adapted and thrived here, just like many people and ideas from around the world. This tree is a powerful symbol of how globalization affects ecosystems, shaping not just what we eat or wear, but how we design and live within our environments. It‚Äôs a gentle reminder that cultural exchange extends into the natural world.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>üå¥ Why We Planted the Windmill Palm</h2>
      <p>Choosing this palm wasn‚Äôt just about how it looks (though we‚Äôll admit, it‚Äôs stunning). The Chinese Windmill Palm is exceptionally cold-hardy, able to withstand freezing temperatures ‚Äî making it a rare tropical plant suitable for temperate climates. It requires little maintenance, survives on moderate water, and adds structure and style to any green space. For us, it also acts as a symbol: of strength, tranquility, and the beauty of connection between East and West, old and new.</p>

      <h2>‚ôªÔ∏è Sustainability That Grows</h2>
      <p>Sustainability isn‚Äôt just a buzzword at HIM ‚Äî it‚Äôs part of how we teach, plant, and plan. The Windmill Palm supports this mission beautifully. It‚Äôs long-living, which means less need for replanting. It thrives without pesticides and helps purify the air. Its sturdy leaves even attract small pollinators, making it an unlikely contributor to campus biodiversity. In a world facing climate challenges, choosing low-impact, adaptable species like this is a smart ‚Äî and stylish ‚Äî step forward.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <h2> Sustainability & Non-Native Species in Switzerland</h2>
      <p>The Chinese Windmill Palm, though visually appealing and adaptable, is considered a non-native species in Switzerland. Its ability to spread into local forests‚Äîespecially in the southern region of Ticino‚Äîhas led to ecological concerns. However, responsible cultivation can prevent negative impacts while allowing people to enjoy the tree‚Äôs beauty.</p>
      <p>Here at HIM, we take care to ensure our palm trees support our sustainability values while minimizing their environmental footprint:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prevent Seed Dispersal:</strong> We regularly remove the flowers and fruit to avoid unwanted spreading into nearby ecosystems.</li>
        <li><strong>Mindful Placement:</strong> Our palms are planted away from forest edges and sensitive habitats to reduce the risk of invasion.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsible Waste Disposal:</strong> Trimmings and organic waste are carefully disposed of to avoid germination in the wild.</li>
        <li><strong>Education & Awareness:</strong> Students and staff learn about non-native species and sustainable landscaping practices as part of our living curriculum.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This balanced approach lets us celebrate the tree‚Äôs symbolism and resilience while respecting Switzerland‚Äôs rich biodiversity. By managing non-native plants wisely, we can create green spaces that are both beautiful and ecologically responsible.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>üß† What the Palm Teaches Us</h2>
      <p>This tree isn‚Äôt just decoration ‚Äî it‚Äôs an educator. Through it, students learn about plant migration, landscape architecture, and the ethics of introducing non-native species. It prompts discussions on climate adaptation and ecological balance. Just as HIM welcomes students from all over the world, our garden welcomes plants that teach us how to adapt, integrate, and thrive. The Windmill Palm is both botanical and philosophical: an emblem of growth, resilience, and the global story of nature.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>üì∏ See the Palm for Yourself</h2>
      <p>As you stroll through our campus, you‚Äôll spot these majestic palms standing tall and proud. Each one tells a story ‚Äî of where it came from, where it is now, and where we‚Äôre going as a planet. You can scan the QR code at our signage to learn more, watch its seasonal changes, and see how sustainability and beauty come together at HIM. Because learning doesn‚Äôt just happen in classrooms ‚Äî it grows in gardens too.</p>
